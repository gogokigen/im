# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gogokigen

I have a deep-seated interest in cellular network protocols, and I have been diligently working in this specialized field for several years.

However, I also harbor a strong concern for human rights issues and hold a fascination for the Japanese language. This website serves as a record of my engagements with these topics and a repository for my learning notes.
